Functional Programming :
========================

Why we need functional Programming :
 
   It is a declarative style of programming rather than imperative .Declarative way of implementation  which will reduce the code base and number of lines.
   
   

Functional Interface : Interface with only one abstract method.
	Predicate,Function,Consumer
	Ex : check the exmaple FP02FunctionalInterface.java

:: operator  -- Used to call the static methods using class name
	Ex : ClassName::MethodName
	
filter -  filter the stream of values which will accept the Predicate interface.

		Predicate - Functional interface with one method which returns true or false
		
map   - Convert each element in the stream to something. for ex : squaring , counting no of characters. This will accept Fuction interface.

		Function - This interface takes inputs and returns values.
		
		

	
		
		

Complete Application using microservices and Angular :


1. Authentication code
2. Exception handling code
3. Validations
4. Request validations
5. Service and Repository layers
6. Caching
7. Configuring the logging ( Slueth,zipkin)
8. Setup different environment ( dev QA)
9. Actuator,Promothues , Graphana 
10.Integration Tests
11. Docker images and k8s configuration
12. CI CD pipeline to deploy
